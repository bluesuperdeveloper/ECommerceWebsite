# final-project-sirisha

What my project/app is all about?
It is a online website app. 

Functionalities:
Users can login through thier username and password, create/register thier account, logout, do shopping and many more.
The user can look for all items or can filter items with respect to few filters.
In my app they can click a checkbox where it display items/products which are only in stock.
You can serch for items/product in search field.
On click on 'add to cart' buttons the states of the button changes.

Technichalities:
The app is built using easily available js library i.e raect.js

All about status state:
I have three states in the app on button click.
The three states are :
ADD TO CART
PLACE ORDER
READY TO SHIP

On each button clcik the status state changes with button color change!!
Once you click on to 'ADD TO CART' it will not change to this status back again.
Only the place order and ship to order status can change.
